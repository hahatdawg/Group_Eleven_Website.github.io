<h2> The Outline </h2> 
<pre> 
For the stream outline, our group plans to do a steam in 2 hours and 30 minutes. The stream will be done at 7:00PM since our target audience will be home by this time and probably finished their 
dinner and will have free time to spend with us. Our stream will be divided into 8 parts as seen in the photo below:

In a span of 2 hours and 30 minutes, our group should be able to play 3 or more games. Two games that we can play while the viewers are watching, and at least one game that can be played with the viewers. 
We decided to put the multiplayer games as the last segment so that they viewers will have something to look forward to.
